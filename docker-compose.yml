# You should know that Docker Compose works with services.
# 1 service = 1 container.
# For example, a service, a server, a client, a database...
# We use the keyword 'services' to start to create services.
services:
  # The name of our service is "postgres"
  # but you can use the name of your choice.
  postgres:
    # Official Postgres image from DockerHub
    image: postgres:14-alpine
    # By default, a Postgres database is running on the 5432 port.
    # If we want to access the database from our computer (outside the container),
    # we must share the port with our computer's port.
    # The syntax is [port we want on our machine]:[port we want to retrieve in the container]
    # Note: You are free to change your computer's port,
    # but take into consideration that it will change the way
    # you are connecting to your database.
    ports:
      - 5432:5432
    # The `volumes` tag allows us to share a folder with our container.
    # Its syntax is as follows: [folder path on our machine]:[folder path to retrieve in the container]
    volumes:
      # In this example, we share the folder `~/.share/postgres` in our root repository,
      # with the default PostgreSQL data path.
      # It means that every time the repository is modifying the data inside
      # of `/var/lib/postgresql/data/`, automatically the change will appear in `db-data`.
      # You don't need to create the `~/.share/postgres` folder.
      # Docker Compose will do it for you.
      - ~/.share/postgres:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=realworld
      - POSTGRES_USER=realworld
